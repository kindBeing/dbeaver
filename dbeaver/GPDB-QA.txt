1. CREATE TABLE foo (a int, b text) DISTRIBUTED BY (a);

- How to set a schema as active in order to avoid specifying qualified names.
- Refreshing the schema/database to show newly create tables. 


2. CREATE TABLE bar (a int, b text) WITH (appendonly=true) DISTRIBUTED BY (a);

- DDL does not include the 'with(appendonly=true)' clause.
- As per the documentation UPDATE and DELETE are not allowed on append-optimized tables in 
a serializable transaction and will cause the transaction to abort. But even when 
appendonly=true is set, UPDATE and DELETE work. 

























Questions:
1. What do we mean by ' CLUSTER, DECLARE...FOR UPDATE, and triggers are not supported with append-optimized tables.'
